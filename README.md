# A divider role I have is not being shown as a divider.
This plugin was made to support a variety of divider formats. However, if a certain divider name isn't working (or is being flagged incorrectly), please create an issue with the role name so I can update the plugin to support it.

# How can I change the divider style?
You can style the dividers by selecting `.role-divider`. Here's an example made by @12944qwerty:
```css
.role-divider {
  font-weight: normal !important;
  text-transform: capitalize;
  margin-bottom: 2px;
  margin-top: 2px !important;
}
```

# Caveats
As of now, it is not possible to remove divider roles from a member. In the meantime, you can temporarily disable the plugin, use a bot command, or use another device. This feature should be coming eventuallyâ„¢.
