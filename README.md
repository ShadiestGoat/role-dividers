# Is a divider role not being shown as a divider?
This plugin was made to support a variety of divider formats. However, if a certain divider name isn't working (or is being flagged incorrectly), please create an issue with the role name so I can update the plugin to support it.

# Caveats
As of now, it is not possible to remove divider roles from a member. In the meantime, you can temporarily disable the plugin, use a bot command, or use another device. This feature should be coming eventuallyâ„¢.
